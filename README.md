# WoundHealing Project
Would Healing Project - Deep Learning &amp; Mathematics <newline>
In this research project, we use 2 main methods which are Partial Differential Equations to study the healing process of the wound as well as Deep Learning to retrieve the boundary of the pictures of wounds.
## 1. Big Idea: 
  We want to analyze the wound healing process by using mathematical models. We treat the way protein, keratin, covers at a wound as a diffusion process. There are many ways to solve this numerical problem. However, we believe that ADI method is the good way to do that.
  Our problem will be divided into two main tasks: 
  - 1. Working with the wound images. 
  - 2. Working with the mathematical model which is analyzing the wound healing process using ADI method.
